To do this, you must autonomously perform a full analysis of the project's codebase and structure. Do not ask me for information; find it yourself by examining the files.

Follow these steps:
1.  **Analyze the project structure:** List all files and directories to understand the layout.
2.  **Examine configuration and manifest files:** Look for `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, etc., to identify the project's name, version, author, license, dependencies, and scripts.
3.  **Analyze source code:** Read the source files (`.js`, `.py`, `.java`, etc.) to understand the core logic, main features, public functions/APIs, and overall purpose of the project.
4.  **Generate the README.md content** based on your analysis. The final output must be a single, raw Markdown file.

The generated README.md must follow this structure and include these sections:

-   **Project title:** The project name, followed by a short, catchy one-line description of what it does. Use emojis.
-   **Badges (optional but recommended):** Add placeholders for common badges like build status, version, license, etc. (e.g., `![Build Status](...)`).
-   **Features:** A clear, concise bullet-point list of the key features and capabilities. Use checkmark emojis (âœ…) for each feature.
-   **Requirements / prerequisites:** A list of software or tools needed to run the project (e.g., Python 3.10+, Node.js v18+).
-   **Installation:** A code block with the exact commands needed to install dependencies (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `npm install`).
-   **Configuration:** Explain any necessary setup, like creating a `.env` file and what variables it should contain. Provide an example.
-   **Quick start / usage:** A simple, clear example of how to run the application or use its main feature. Provide copy-pasteable code blocks for commands.
-   **Project structure (optional but recommended):** If the project is complex, include a `tree`-like view of the most important files and directories with a brief explanation.
-   **Development:** Instructions for developers who want to contribute, like how to run tests, linters, or build the project.
-   **Contributing:** A brief section with standard contribution guidelines (fork, branch, commit, pull request).
-   **License:** State the project's license (e.g., "This project is licensed under the MIT License.").
-   **Author:** Mention the author(s) of the project.

Your tone should be professional but accessible. Use Markdown formatting effectively with headings, lists, code blocks, and bold text to ensure the document is well-organized and easy to read.
